# Kotlin - About App

* This android application deals with the basics of layout.
* We've seen TextView, ScrollView, Buttons, ImageView, and LinearLayout.
* Extracting custom style to the styles.xml file, adding resources to the dimen.xml file, and then reusing them for other components.


## App details:

* This is a very basic app, which displays details about yourself, such as name and a small bio, with scrollable function.


## Update 24-12-2020

* We used the data binding to improve app performance. Check out the data binding documentation for more details.
